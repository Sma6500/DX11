# DX11

## Overview
This repository contains an adaptation of the **DX11 algorithm** for **weekly or monthly time series**, based on detrending approach from the study:

> [Read the paper here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JC015701)

## Features
- Designed for **weekly** time series processing with exemple for chl-a satellite data
- The algorithm can be adapt to other timesteps by changing the convolution kernel lenght and the Henderson filter

## How to Use
- Depending on the data timestep use the weekly or the monthly file
